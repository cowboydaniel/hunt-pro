# Hunt Pro Roadmap

The roadmap highlights upcoming improvements and strategic investments planned for Hunt Pro. Timelines are intentionally flexible to accommodate field feedback and environmental testing requirements.

## Short Term

- **Dependency manifest** – Publish a `requirements.txt` that documents the minimum PySide6 packages and scientific dependencies needed to run the application.
- **Automated tests** – Add unit tests for calculations in `ballistics.py` and data persistence in `game_log.py`.
- **Configuration UX** – Expose module settings (paths, calibration data, default profiles) through consistent dialogs and validate inputs before saving.

## Medium Term

- **Offline mapping** – Integrate cached map tiles and enhanced GPS abstraction so navigation remains usable without connectivity.
- **Sensor integrations** – Support Bluetooth rangefinders, weather meters, and shot timers through the modular device interface described in `main.py`.
- **Data export** – Provide CSV/JSON export for hunts logged in `game_log.py` and ballistic profiles in `ballistics.py`.

## Long Term

- **Mobile companion** – Explore a synchronized mobile companion app for quick field data capture and offline sync.
- **Collaborative hunts** – Implement team-based session sharing with live location and event streaming via peer-to-peer networking.
- **Machine learning insights** – Use historical hunt data to recommend stands, predict animal movement, and optimize loadouts.
